I planned this project after getting inspired by the book "Skin Deep: Looking Beyond the Tattoos" by Steven Burton. The Book uniquely highlights the impact tattoos have on the way a person is perceived by showing what each participant might look like without them. It took Steven about 400 hours in retouching the photos and removing the tattoos. Can deep learning do a decent job or can it even match? This was the starting point of this project!!

I would suggest everyone to have a look at the book, u can get it from Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/Skin-Deep-Looking-Beyond-Tattoos/dp/157687849X. 

# Synthetic data generation

Overlaying Apdrawing dataset along with some background removed tattoos designs, This can be easily done using Python Opencv. 

Apdrawing dataset has line art pairs which will mimic tattoos lines, this will help the model to learn and remove those lines.
